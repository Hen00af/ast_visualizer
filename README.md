# What is CFG (Context-Free Grammar)

A **CFG (Context-Free Grammar)** defines the syntax rules of a language â€”  
it describes *how commands can be combined* to form valid structures.

In this minishell, CFG is essential to build the **AST (Abstract Syntax Tree)**,  
which represents the logical structure of a command line.

---

### ðŸ§  Why it's important

- CFG defines the **hierarchy and relationships** between operators (`|`, `&&`, `<`, `()`, etc.)  
- It allows the shell to **parse** commands recursively and accurately.  
- Once parsed, the shell can **execute** them in the correct order according to the AST.
